safeway-coupons is a script that will log in to an account on safeway.com, and
attempt to select all of the "Just for U" electronic coupons on the site so
they don't have to each be clicked manually. For best results, run this program
once a day or so with a cron daemon.

Prerequisites: Python 3 and sendmail.

You need to specify the path to a config file (using -c or --accounts-config).
Your config file should contain an email sender address and Safeway account login
information. For example:

[_global]
email_sender = sender@example.com

[safeway.account@example.com]
password = 12345
notify_email = your.email@example.com

(notify_email is optional, if you want to be notified at a different email.)
