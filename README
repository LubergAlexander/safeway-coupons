safeway-coupons is a script that will log in to an account on safeway.com, and
attempt to select all of the "Just for U" electronic coupons on the site so
they don't have to each be clicked manually. For best results, run this program
once a day or so with a cron daemon.

For the script to work, you need Python 3 and sendmail. Make sure to configure
your Safeway account login information at the bottom of the script.
